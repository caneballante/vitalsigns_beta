								<h4 class="aqua">Marine Water Condition Index</h4>
								<p>The Washington State Department of Ecology developed the Marine Water Condition Index to measure change in water quality against pre-existing conditions. The index addresses the large amount of variability inherent in marine water quality measures, in order to detect subtle and persistent change. The Marine Water Condition Index integrates 12 variables that describe an important aspect of water quality conditions (e.g. temperature, salinity, nutrient balance, algae biomass, dissolved oxygen). Toxic chemicals are not part of the index.</p>

										<p>
										<p>The Marine Water Condition Index provides a framework that links changes in local water quality and physical conditions to the larger context of oceanic water quality and natural variability. The Marine Water Condition Index detects changes in water conditions relevant to eutrophication and physical conditions against site and seasonal-specific baseline conditions measured from 1999 to 2008.</p>
										<p>The index reports on a scale of +50 to -50 indicating a complete positive or negative change from baseline conditions, with zero indicating unchanged conditions relative to the baseline. The index is reported for 12 regions.</p>
										<p>There is no target for the Marine Water Condition Index. However, since the index is designed to show changes in water quality, positive values indicate relatively improved marine water quality relative the baseline, and negative values indicate worse marine water quality relative to the baseline.</p>

								<div class="aquaBarHeader">What are the targets? </div>
								<h5>2020 target</h5>
								<p>The Leadership Council has not adopted a specific target for the Marine Water Condition Index.</p>
								<p>The Leadership Council did, however, adopt a 2020 target related to one key component of the index: Keep dissolved oxygen levels from declining more than 0.2 milligrams per liter in any part of Puget Sound as a result of human input. </p>
								<h5>Interim targets</h5>

								<h4 class="aqua">Marine Water Condition Index</h4>
								<p>Marine water quality was slightly higher in Puget Sound in 2013 relative to the 10-year, 1999-2008 baseline. Looking more closely at water quality region by region, scores were relatively similar to each other in 2013 (i.e., there was lower regional variability). Conditions were the best in Admiralty Reach, South Sound, Elliott Bay, Commencement Bay and South Hood Canal. In all other regions, conditions were at or near the baseline. </p>
								<p>In the short-term, water quality in Puget Sound has not changed much in the last three years. Values have hovered around 0, the baseline value. Before that, conditions were at an all-time low over much of Puget Sound in 2009 and 2010.</p>
								<p>Over the long-term, Marine Water Condition Index scores have generally declined. The decline is illustrated in the results table by 1) a shift in the past 15 years from green in the early years to red in the later years, and 2) a general increase in negative scores. These results indicate that conditions overall are shifting in the direction of lower water quality. The largest changes were in Bellingham Bay (20% decline), followed by a lesser degree in Central Basin, Sinclair Inlet, South Hood Canal, Oakland Bay, Whidbey Basin (decline of more than 10%). Recently, more favorable ocean conditions have slowed the apparent decline, particularly in Admiralty Reach, South Sound, Elliott Bay and Commencement Bay.</p>
								<p>Marine water quality trends since 1999 may be best described by periods of about two to four consecutive years when water quality is better than average, followed by periods when water quality is worse than expected. From year to year, there is not a linear and one-way trend. Instead, the values go up and down, depending on both local and regional oceanographic conditions. Therefore, it is best to consider long-term trends to determine whether water quality is improving. </p>

									<h4 class="aqua">Why is this happening?</h4>
										<p>The largest driver of declining marine water quality has been increasing nitrate concentrations. This also affected the balance of nutrients in the system which can affect the marine food web at its base. Over the past 15 years, nitrate levels have increased steadily despite ocean variability. Because nitrate is an important plant nutrient, increasing nitrate loads can fuel algae blooms which, as the algae subsequently die and decay, can drive low dissolved oxygen events.</p>
										<p>In recent years, marine water quality has generally been better than the baseline because water was cooler and fresher and as a result oxygen levels were increased. Nutrient concentrations were beneficially low in 2013 and maintained neutral index scores, yet physical water conditions already started to change. The recent influence of the Pacific Ocean will likely result in warmer sea surface temperatures on the coast, and lower oxygen levels in Puget Sound. Thus, we expect lower index scores for 2014.</p>
										<p>There are two dominant sources of nitrate in Puget Sound waters: input from ocean waters flowing into Puget Sound and human pollution. Recent evidence suggests that increasing nitrate but no increase in ocean minerals in Puget Sound points to a predominately non-oceanic source of nitrogen or a potential shift in the lower food web of Puget Sound. See <a href="https://fortress.wa.gov/ecy/publications/publications/1403024.pdf">this poster</a> for more details about this hypothesis. However, as discussed earlier, the overall contribution of human inputs to low dissolved oxygen in Puget Sound remains a topic of active study. For more information about the impact of human activities on oxygen in Puget Sound, see the “dissolved oxygen” indicator.</p>
