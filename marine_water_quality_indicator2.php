				<div class="aquaBarHeader">What is the indicator? </div>
				<h4 class="aqua">This indicator is the amount of dissolved oxygen in marine waters.</h4>
				<p>
				  Low dissolved oxygen in marine waters can create significant problems, such as extensive fish kills. The addition of excessive nutrients from human activities are often suspected of creating, or exacerbating, the conditions that lead to low oxygen in Puget Sound. Nitrogen can fuel algae blooms, which decompose and draw down oxygen. The human sources of nutrients include wastewater treatment plants, failed septic systems, and fertilizers that reach Puget Sound.</p>
				  <p>Processes leading to low oxygen also may be connected to other problems such as high carbon dioxide in the water and more acidic waters.</p>
				  <p>To reduce the frequency and severity of low dissolved oxygen and associated problems in Puget Sound, the Leadership Council adopted a target intended to minimize any local human contributions that worsen low dissolved oxygen in Puget Sound. However, the issue is complicated by the fact that dissolved oxygen naturally exhibits a high degree of variability in marine waters, changing almost continuously with time of day, location, season, tidal cycle, depth, the mixing and movement of different water sources, and many other factors. Also, there are several main sources of nitrogen entering Puget Sound, including the ocean (generally the largest overall source), watershed sources (some of which are natural, and some of which are human), groundwater, and the atmosphere. Watershed sources include natural nitrogen inputs from forested land areas as well as increased nitrogen from developed land areas.</p>
				  <p>Consequently, determining the precise degree to which human inputs are responsible for a relatively small decline in dissolved oxygen, relative to the normal range of variability, is a complex issue. Addressing the issue requires a combination of good monitoring data, studies on the sources of nitrogen, and sophisticated mathematical models.</p>
				  <p>The Department of Ecology monitors oxygen throughout Puget Sound as part of the <a href="http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/eap/mar_wat/data.html" target="_blank">ambient monitoring program.</a> The program includes monthly profiles of oxygen and related parameters, continuous monitoring at select moorings, and ferry-based monitoring of near-surface conditions. Oxygen data are also part of <a href="http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/eap/mar_wat/mwci.html" target="_blank">the Marine Water Condition Index</a>, the other indicator under the Marine Water Quality Vital Sign.</p>
			    <p>The target established by the Leadership Council focuses on how much human contributions worsen dissolved oxygen. Since this cannot be monitored directly, The Department of Ecology uses computer models to tease apart different influences. Many processes influence dissolved oxygen, including Pacific Ocean conditions, climate patterns, seasonal light and temperature, stratification and mixing, river and wastewater inputs, sediment processes, and biological processes. <a href="http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/eap/Nitrogen/Index.html" target="_blank">This Department of Ecology web site</a> summarizes what we know about nitrogen throughout the Puget Sound ecosystem.</p>

				<h5>Is the indicator making progress toward the 2020 target? </h5>
				<p> <span><img src="images/status_no_data.png" width="118" height="121" alt=""/>No data are available yet to assess the progress of this indicator.</p>
				<p>
Using modeling to assess the human-related contributions of nitrogen, the model results for 2006 show that the 2020 target value is not met. Updates to the model are underway and will be used to re-evaluate whether the 2020 target is met.</p>
<p>The latest models show mixed results for human contribution to the low oxygen problem.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Throughout most of Puget Sound, the modeled oxygen depletion resulting from of human-related inputs to Puget Sound is below the target value of 0.2 mg/L.<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>However, in local areas, including South and Central Puget Sound, the oxygen depletion caused by nutrient inputs from humans slightly exceeds or is at the target value of 0.2 mg/L. Areas with limited flushing generally are most sensitive to inputs of nutrients like nitrogen by humans.</li>

              <p>Figure 1 shows Salish Sea model results for the impacts from current (2006) local human nutrient sources from wastewater treatment plants and watersheds. Results are expressed as the average oxygen depletion in September and October in deep waters of the Salish Sea, which may not be fine enough to identify localized impacts.</p>
                <p>The Department of Ecology recently evaluated human impacts on oxygen in several areas of Puget Sound and the Salish Sea. Using modeling tools developed with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Ecology determined that current human sources from wastewater treatment plants and watersheds cause less than 0.2 mg/L of DO depletion on average at the large scale (Figure 1). Areas with limited flushing generally are most sensitive to inputs of nutrients like nitrogen by humans. Ecology is currently upgrading the model to include simulation of sediment/water fluxes because this was found to be a major influence on the predicted dissolved oxygen depletion.</p>

              <p>Figure 2 shows South and Central Puget Sound model results for the impacts from current local human nutrient sources from wastewater treatment plants and watersheds. Results are based on the maximum oxygen depletion for September anywhere in the water column.</p>
              <p>A related project further identifies the areas most sensitive to human inputs within South and Central Puget Sound specifically. These include the ends of several inlets in South Puget Sound as well as East Passage (Figure 2). In those limited areas, human nutrient inputs are causing minimum oxygen levels to fall by about 0.2 mg/L. These areas need a closer look, which is underway now. However, most of South and Central Puget Sound falls within the target established for dissolved oxygen. Low dissolved oxygen concentrations do happen, but these are primarily driven by the Pacific Ocean, circulation, and the seasonal cycles of light and temperature.</p>

              <p><em>Source: <a href="https://fortress.wa.gov/ecy/publications/SummaryPages/1403007.html">Roberts et al. (2014)</a></em></p>
<p>Figure 3 shows Salish Sea model results for the potential impacts from (a) 2070 human nutrient sources, (b) plus future river flows and changes in circulation, (c) plus Pacific Ocean trends extrapolated to 2070, (d) plus increased air temperature projected by the UW Climate Impacts Group. Results are expressed as the average oxygen depletion in September and October in the deep waters of the Salish Sea.</p>
<p>Ecology also evaluated future conditions within Puget Sound in the face of increasing population, changes in the Pacific Ocean, climate shifts, and air temperature increases (Figure 3). By 2070, the population will likely double, oxygen could decline significantly in the Pacific Ocean, changes in snowpack will alter how much freshwater reaches Puget Sound, and the temperature will increase. Future population growth would worsen oxygen impacts, primarily in South and Central Puget Sound, at levels that would not meet the targets. Changes in river flows may offset impacts in some regions, but they could add to impacts in other regions of Puget Sound.</p>
<p>Declining trends in Pacific Ocean dissolved oxygen, if they continue, would decrease oxygen compared with current conditions throughout most of the region, with the greatest impacts closer to the Pacific Ocean and declining landward. Warming air temperatures would worsen oxygen conditions further, particularly in shallow bays.</p>
<p>Future conditions in our models are far more uncertain than current conditions. More work is needed to understand the trends in the Pacific Ocean and the likelihood they could continue. However, we need to consider potential future conditions today.</p>
              <h5>Why is this happening?</h5>
                <p>Dissolved oxygen patterns reflect complex interactions of physics, chemistry, and biology. Concentrations vary tremendously around Puget Sound, near the surface or at the bottom, and during different seasons of the year. Using computer models, we have learned that most of this variation occurs due to conditions in the Pacific Ocean, climate influences, and circulation patterns within Puget Sound.</p>
                <p>Nutrients contributed by humans have the greatest impacts on South and Central Puget Sound because of the way water circulates. Near-bottom waters flow toward the southern end of Puget Sound, away from the ocean. These carry nutrients from both natural sources and human sources.</p>
                <p>Algae grow where they have ample light and nutrients. Poor circulation and warm temperatures enhance algae growth. As the algae die, settle to the bottom, and decompose, oxygen is used in the process. The dissolved oxygen target focuses on how much more algae growth occurs due to our human contributions. Nutrients from the Pacific Ocean and natural sources around Puget Sound fuel a natural level of algae growth that can be increased due to human contributions. The ends of inlets are particularly sensitive both to natural and to human sources of nutrients.</p>
                <p>Human nutrient inputs have increased over what would naturally flow to Puget Sound under forested conditions, and will continue to increase with our population. However, the Pacific Ocean provides far greater amounts of nitrogen to fuel algae growth within Puget Sound. Our human sources of nitrogen should still be controlled through existing management actions for multiple reasons, such as to protect the quality of our freshwater and groundwater. These may be more sensitive than Puget Sound itself.</p>
                <p>Understanding the impacts of local human activities on dissolved oxygen in Puget Sound is a long-term endeavor. We continue to improve our knowledge of what drives Puget Sound dissolved oxygen patterns through monitoring programs and modeling analyses.</p>
