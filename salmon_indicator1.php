				<div class="pinkBarHeader">What is this indicator? </div>
		<p>	This indicator is Chinook salmon population abundance as measured by the number of natural origin adult fish returning to spawn.</p>
<p>Chinook population abundance is reported here two ways: The number of natural origin spawners and the number of natural origin recruits. </p>
<p>Spawning escapement is the number of Chinook salmon returning to rivers to spawn. Spawner abundance is normally estimated each year by counting the number of redds (gravel nests) in a river. Redds are counted by walking the stream and/or from boats or aircraft. </p>
<p>For many populations, some hatchery-origin salmon mix with natural-origin salmon on the spawning grounds, complicating our estimates of natural-origin salmon returns. The proportion of spawners that were natural or hatchery origin is typically estimated based on the composition of carcasses and then extrapolated back to the total spawning population to estimate the number of natural-origin versus hatchery-origin spawners.</p> 
<p>The second measure, the total number of natural-origin recruits, represents the potential return of adult salmon to the spawning rivers if there were no commercial, subsistence, or recreational harvest affecting them. This is the estimated total number of natural-origin adult salmon before human harvest. The numbers of hatchery-origin fish were excluded from both estimates of Chinook abundance.</p>
<p>In our latest evaluation of change over time, the mean (annual) abundance of spawning Chinook salmon for the 3-year period 2011 – 2013 was compared to the 5-year baseline period 2006 – 2010. The comparison was done both for the total abundance (all populations combined), and the change in abundance of each population individually.</p>

				<!--*********************************PINK HEADER*********************************-->

				<p><span><img src="images/status_getting_worse.png" width="120" height="123" alt=""/></span>No, this indicator lost ground relative to a baseline reference.</p>

<p>The total number of naturally spawning Chinook salmon has declined, the 2014 interim targets for spawning Chinook salmon have not been met, there is little sign of improvement in each biogeographic region, and most populations remain far below their recovery planning targets adopted by the National Marine Fisheries Service.</p> 
<ul>
	<li>The mean total abundance of naturally spawning Chinook was lower in 2011 – 2013 than in 2006 – 2010, and this decline was statistically significant (p=0.08). </li>
	<li>Among the 22 individual populations, 13 declined and 6 increased. In the three remaining cases (Elwha, North Fork Stilliquamish, South Fork Stilliquamish), the methods of estimating population abundance changed over the time period such that direct comparisons cannot be made.</li>

				<p><img src="images/salmon_chart.png" width="446" height="489" alt="Abundance of Chinook natural-origin spawners in Puget Sound, 1990-2010"/></p>
			<p>Chinook populations in Puget Sound exhibit large annual variations in abundance, as well as long-term fluctuations (over 10 or more years) that confuse simple evaluations of short- or long-term trends in numbers (Figure 1). Long-term natural-origin spawner abundance numbers have shown little progress toward the target, with numbers declining since the early 2000s. </p>
<p>Overall productivity and the total number of natural-origin salmon recruits have declined according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. All Puget Sound Chinook populations are currently well below abundance levels (recovery goals) needed for populations to recover and to reduce their risk of extinction (Figure 2). </p>

				<p>Trends for Chinook recruits were calculated for five- and 10-year periods. For 2006-2010, only two out of 22 populations showed a statistically significant trend. One population increased (Sammamish), and one population (Skokomish) decreased. In contrast, for a 10-year trend analysis from 2001-2010, nine out of 22 populations showed a statistically significant decrease in the number of fish.</p>
