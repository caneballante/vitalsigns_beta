				<!--*********************************PURPLE HEADER*********************************-->
				<div class="purpBarHeader">What is the indicator? </div>
				<p>This indicator is the length of new and removed armor, and the resulting net length, (new minus removed) permitted under the Hydraulic Project Approval.</p>
<p>Shoreline armoring is the most common type of shoreline modification on Puget Sound. The term includes structures like bulkheads, seawall, and rip rap. Armoring directly alters geologic processes that supply sediment to build and maintain beaches and spits. Armoring also impact erosion patterns on nearby beaches, alter beach substrate and hydrology, and reduce the availability of large wood.</p>
<p>These physical changes to beaches can diminish the availability and condition of key shoreline habitats. Armoring can also directly impact organisms and ecological processes by burying or displacing upper beach habitat and altering the natural transition between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Impacts of armoring differ from one coastal setting to another, but have been demonstrated both on Puget Sound and elsewhere to impact habitat for fish, birds, and invertebrates. On the other hand, removing armoring increases food and shelter for salmon, sand for small fish to lay eggs, and invertebrates that many species of birds eat.</p>
<p>Because of these adverse impacts on coastal processes and nearshore habitat and the positive results of removing armoring, the goal is to decrease the amount of new armoring that occurs on Puget Sound, while also seeking opportunities to remove armoring where feasible.  As our understanding of techniques to avoid impacts and consider alternatives related to armoring increases, the amount, type and location of new armoring   is changing too.</p>
<p>As new armoring is being constructed, concurrent efforts are deployed to remove armoring primarily for habitat restoration. Thus, it is the difference between new and removed armoring that is of interest to address the Partnership&rsquo;s target for 2020 specifically, reported here as the net amount of shoreline armoring. The target for this indicator is that new armoring be less than removed armoring cumulatively from 2011 to 2020.</p>
<p>Alterations to the shoreline are regulated primarily by two state laws, the Shoreline Management Act and the Hydraulic Code. Permits issued under the Hydraulic Code for in-water and shoreline construction activities include the length of added, replaced or removed armoring Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife has been tracking Hydraulic Project Approvals (HPAs) permits since YEAR. Thus, data reported here were compiled from HPAs issued by the Washington Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife.  While other data from local studies and shoreline permits under the Shoreline Management Act may have more detailed information, the HPA database is the most consistent and accessible for all of Puget Sound.  HPA projects were identified as:</p>
                <ol start="1" type="1">
                  <li>New      (previously unarmored shoreline)</li>
                  <li>Replacement      (complete replacement of existing armoring)</li>
                  <li>Removal      (removal of existing armoring without replacement) </li>
                </ol>
                <p>The Puget Sound Nearshore Ecosystem Restoration Project (PSNERP) has compiled and reported on changes to shorelines in Puget Sound over the past several decades. Data reported here on the length of shoreline and the overall amount of existing shoreline armoring in Puget Sound  is from PSNERP.</p>

				<div class="purpBarHeader"><strong>Is the indicator making progress toward the 2020 target? </strong></div>
				<p> <span><img src="images/status_getting_better.png" width="118" height="121" alt=""/>Yes, this indicator has made progress relative to the baseline reference.</p>
				<p>Because the rate of permitting new armoring under the HPA has slowed and more armoring was permitted for removal than added in 2014 and 2015, this indicator appears to make some progress toward the 2020 target. </p>
<p>More permitted armoring was gained than lost cumulatively since 2011, resulting in a net cumulative length of 1.1 miles (6,000 feet). However, in 2014 and 2015, more permitted armoring was removed than was added, a ratio that aligns well with the 2020 target.</p> 
				<ul><li>New armoring continues to be constructed under the HPAs at an average pace of 0.66 miles (3,483 feet) per year (mean of 2011 – 2015), but the pace has slowed incrementally since 2013.</li>
					<li>In contrast, during the same time period, shoreline armoring was removed under the HPA at an average rate of 0.4 miles (2,105 feet) per year—not enough to balance out new permitted armoring.</li></ul><p>
Data are derived from the Hydraulic Project Approvals (permits issued for in-water work and shoreline construction activities).

				<h4>NEW, REMOVED AND CUMULATIVE NET ARMOR IN PUGET SOUND <br />
					<em>2005 – 2015 </em></h4>

				<blockquote><p><em>Source: Data compiled from Hydraulic Project Approvals issued by Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife, Habitat Program.</em> </p></blockquote>
				
				<h5>Why is this happening?</h5>
				<p>The trend in the amount of new armor permitted between 2005 and 2016 decreased, while the amount of armor removed increased. A continued positive trend in removals is likely associated with both: 1) an increased awareness of the impacts to shoreline functions caused by armor, and 2) the efforts by restoration groups to address the problem by seeking potential removal opportunities.</p>
<p>New armor, however, continues to be constructed at the rate of about 0.66 miles per year. This apparent contradiction is in part because the situations where new armoring is occurring are quite different than those where it is being removed.  New armoring is driven by a perception of risk—sometimes a very real risk—to property and safety. New armoring may occur following severe storms and landslides and may be done as an emergency measure, and therefore may not receive the scrutiny normally applied to such projects. Shorelines are inherently dynamic. Much new armoring is likely occurring on properties that were laid out or developed decades ago, without sufficient attention to erosion and flood hazards.</p>
<p>On the positive side, restoration groups appear to have become increasingly successful at obtaining funding from restoration grant programs for armor removal projects as indicated by both the scale and number of removals in recent years. In addition, public facilities such as state and county parks have become a large component of the armor removal trend. </p>
<p>Grant funds have also contributed to increased outreach to shoreline property owners, agency staff, contractors, and others who have an interest in the condition of Puget Sound shorelines. Recent studies have provided demographic information on shoreline property owners to facilitate outreach activities that resonate with these owners who have considerable influence on shoreline activities. In addition, local governments on Puget Sound are in the process of updating Shoreline Master Programs in accordance with the new state guidelines.  We expect these to reduce the amount of armoring in the future, but our current data do not reflect the potential effect of these new SMPs.  We will be looking at the data over the next few years to see if we can detect a change in armoring trends in jurisdictions with updated SMPs.</p>
