			<div> 
				<!--*********************************PURPLE HEADER*********************************-->
				<div class="purpBarHeader">What is the indicator? </div>
				<p>This indicator is the total amount of shoreline armoring.</p>
				<p>Shoreline armoring is the most common type of shoreline modification on Puget Sound. Armoring directly alters geologic processes that build and maintain beaches and spits. Bulkheads also impact erosion patterns on nearby beaches, alter beach substrate and hydrology, and reduce the availability of large wood.</p>
				<p>These physical changes to beaches can diminish the availability and condition of key shoreline habitats. Armoring can also directly impact organisms and ecological processes by burying or displacing upper beach habitat and altering the natural transition between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Impacts of armoring differ from one coastal setting to another, but have been demonstrated both on Puget Sound and elsewhere to impact habitat for fish, birds, and invertebrates.</p>
				<p>Because of these adverse impacts on coastal processes and shoreline habitat, the goal is to decrease the amount of new armoring that occurs on Puget Sound, while also seeking opportunities to reduce armoring where feasible.
					As new armoring is being constructed, concurrent efforts are deployed to remove armoring primarily for habitat restoration. Thus, it is the difference between new and removed armoring that is of interest to address the target specifically, reported here as the net amount of shoreline armoring. To reach the target, there has to be a net loss of armoring cumulatively over 2011 to 2020.</p>
				<p>Alterations to the shoreline are regulated primarily by two state laws, the Shoreline Management Act and the Hydraulic Code. Under the Hydraulic Code, project proponents seeking a permit for in-water and shoreline construction activities declare the amount of armoring they plan on adding, replacing, or removing in their application. Thus, data reported here were compiled from Hydraulic Project Approvals (HPAs) issued from January 2005 through December 2012 by the Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife. </p>
				<p> Projects were identified as:</p>
				<ol>
					<li> New (previously unarmored shoreline)</li>
					<li>Replacement (complete replacement of existing armoring)</li>
					<li>Removals (removal of existing armoring without replacement) </li>
				</ol>
				<p>The Puget Sound Nearshore Ecosystem Restoration Project (PSNERP) has been instrumental in compiling and reporting on changes to shorelines in Puget Sound over the past several decades. We relied on their data to report the length of shoreline and the overall amount of existing shoreline armoring in Puget Sound. </p>
				
				<!--*********************************PURPLE HEADER*********************************-->
				<div class="purpBarHeader">What are the targets? </div>
				<h5>2020 target</h5>
				<p>Part 1: From 2011 to 2020, the total amount of armoring removed should be greater than the total amount of new armoring in Puget Sound (total miles removed is greater than the total miles added).<br />
					Part 2: Feeder bluffs receive strategic attention for removal of existing armoring and avoidance of new armoring.<br />
					Part 3: Soft shore techniques are used for all new and replacement armoring, unless it is demonstrably infeasible.</p>

				<!--*********************************PINK HEADER*********************************-->
				<div class="purpBarHeader"><strong>Is the indicator making progress toward the 2020 target? </strong></div>
				<p> <span><img src="images/status_getting_better.png" width="118" height="121" alt=""/>Yes, this indicator has made progress relative to the baseline reference.</p>
				<p>Because the rate of adding new armoring has slowed and more armoring was removed than added in 2014, this indicator appears to make some progress toward the 2020 target. </p>
				<p>More armoring was gained than lost cumulatively since 2011, resulting in a net cumulative length of 1.1 miles (6,000 feet). However, in 2014, more armoring was removed than was added, a ratio that aligns well with the 2020 target. </p>
				<ul>
					<li>New armoring continues to be constructed at an average pace of 0.7 miles (3,700 feet) per year (mean of 2011 – 2014), but the pace has slowed progressively since 2012.  </li>
					<li>In contrast, shoreline armoring is removed at an average rate of 0.4 miles (2,200 feet) per year—not enough to balance out new armoring.  </li>
				</ul>
				<p> Data are derived from the Hydraulic Project Approvals (permits issued for in-water work and shoreline construction activities).</p>
				
				<!--*********************************PURPLE HEADER*********************************-->
				<div class="purpBarHeader">Latest Data</div>
				<h5>Target 1: From 2011 to 2020, the total amount of armoring removed should be greater than the total amount of new armoring in Puget Sound (total miles removed is greater than the total miles added).</h5>
				<img src="images/vs12_shoreline.png" width="750" height="586" alt="Puget Sound Shoreline Armoring 2005-2011" />
				<p><img src="images/vs12_shoreline_byapplicanttype.png" width="750" height="586" alt=""/></p>
				<p><img src="images/vs12_shoreline_removedbyapplicanttype.png" width="750" height="586" alt=""/></p>
				
				<p>The type of applicant that conducts new or armor removal projects was also compiled from the HPA data for years 2005 – 2012. Armoring is particularly extensive in highly developed residential, urban, or industrial centers.</p>
				<p>While most alterations to nearshore areas are heavily regulated, new and replacement shoreline armoring is still relatively commonplace for single-family residences. Single-family residences accounted for 68 percent of the HPA applicants requesting to construct new armoring between 2005 and 2012. In contrast, armor removal projects were primarily conducted on government properties (57 percent), whereas only 11 percent of the removals were on single-family residential properties.</p>
<p><img src="images/vs12_shoreline_newbycounty.png" width="750" height="586" alt=""/></p>



<p>The total amount of existing shoreline armoring varies considerably across the 12 counties that border Puget Sound. </p>
<p>Three counties account for nearly 50 percent of the total existing armoring in Puget Sound: King (13 percent), Pierce (18 percent), and Kitsap (16 percent) counties. In these same three counties, the proportion of shoreline that is armored is relatively high: King 73 percent, Pierce 51 percent, and Kitsap 43 percent. </p>
<p>New armoring was constructed in all 12 counties. However, the HPA data revealed that most of the new armoring permitted between 2005 – 2012 was concentrated in somewhat different areas. Most of the new armoring was constructed in Mason, Island and Kitsap counties, comprising together 48 percent of the total. Pierce, Skagit and San Juan counties also accounted for a substantial amount of the new armoring with a combined total of 35 percent. Therefore, six of the 12 counties in Puget Sound accounted for 83 percent of the new armoring permitted from 2005 through 2012.</p>
<p>The same dataset indicates that armoring was removed in ten counties from 2005-2012. More armoring was removed in Kitsap County, totaling 0.7 miles, than in any other county during this eight year timeframe. A combined total of 0.5 miles was removed among four other counties that included King, Pierce, Mason and Island.  Clallam and Snohomish counties did not account for any armor removal during this period.</p>
<p>Also noteworthy for the 2005 – 2012 time period is the comparatively low amount of new armor permitted in King County (0.1 miles, or 582 feet), coupled with a relatively high quantity of removals (0.1 miles, or 553 feet), resulting in less than 0.01 miles, or only 29 feet, of net new armor.</p>
<p><strong>Why is this happening?</strong></p>
<p>While the amount of new armor permitted between 2011 and 2012 increased slightly, the amount of armor removed increased substantially. A continued positive trend in removals, which has occurred since 2005 albeit at a smaller level, is likely associated with both: 1) an increased awareness of the impacts to shoreline functions caused by armor, and 2) the efforts by restoration groups to address the problem by seeking potential removal opportunities.</p>
<p>New armor, however, continues to be constructed at the rate of about 0.7 miles per year. This apparent contradiction is in part because the situations where new armoring is occurring are quite different than those where it is being removed.  New armoring is driven by a perception of risk—sometimes a very real risk—to property and safety. New armoring may occur following severe storms and landslides and may be done as an emergency measure, and therefore may not receive the scrutiny normally applied to such projects. Shorelines are inherently unstable. Much new armoring is likely occurring on properties that were laid out or developed decades ago, without sufficient attention to erosion and flood hazards.</p>
<p>On the positive side, restoration groups appear to have become increasingly successful at obtaining funding from restoration grant programs for armor removal projects as indicated by both the scale and number of removals in recent years. In addition, public facilities such as state and county parks have become a large component of the armor removal trend. </p>
<p>Grant funds have also contributed to increased outreach to shoreline property owners, agency staff, contractors, and others who have an interest in the condition of Puget Sound shorelines. Recent studies have provided demographic information on shoreline property owners to facilitate outreach activities that resonate with these owners who have considerable influence on shoreline activities. In addition, local governments on Puget Sound are in the process of updating Shoreline Master Programs in accordance with the new state guidelines.  We expect these to reduce the amount of armoring in the future, but our current data do not reflect the potential effect of these new SMPs.  We will be looking at the data over the next few years to see if we can detect a change in armoring trends in jurisdictions with updated SMPs.</p>

<h5>Target 2: Feeder bluffs receive strategic attention for removal of existing armoring and avoidance of new armoring.</h5>
<p>Part of the 2020 target for shoreline armoring includes a focus on preventing new armoring and reducing existing armoring on feeder bluffs that supply sediments to Puget Sound shorelines. Washington State Department of Ecology completed a project in 2014 to map feeder bluffs throughout Puget Sound. This will improve our ability to identify where new armoring is proposed on feeder bluffs and to better quantify the extent to which this occurs.  Increasingly, local regulations specifically discourage armoring on feeder bluffs.</p>
<h5>Target 3: Soft shore techniques are used for all new and replacement armoring, unless it is demonstrably infeasible.</h5>

<p>The 2020 target emphasizes the increased use of softer techniques for both new and replacement armoring. The new Hydraulic Code (Chapter 220-660 WAC) effective on July 1, 2015 defines soft shore techniques. Beginning at that time, HPAs issued for armoring should include specifics regarding use of these techniques. From that point on, we should be able to query the database for information on how much is being installed, where it is being installed, how it is being installed (new or replacement work) and who is installing it (residential applications, public facilities, etc.).</p>
<p>The Washington State Department of Ecology has recently <a href="https://fortress.wa.gov/ecy/publications/publications/1406009.pdf">developed guidance for local communities</a> trying to implement softer techniques through their Shoreline Master Programs (Gianou 2014). In 2014, WDFW published the <a href="http://wdfw.wa.gov/publications/01583">Marine Shoreline Design Guidelines</a> offering new guidance on design and construction of softer measures (Johannessen et al. 2014). Together, we expect the guidance to lead to even greater use of soft methods of shoreline stabilization. </p>
