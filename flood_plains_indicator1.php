				<!--*********************************PURPLE HEADER*********************************-->
				<div class="purpBarHeader">What is the indicator? </div>
				<p>This indicator is the restoration of floodplains.</p>
				<p>Floodplains are areas adjacent to rivers that are formed primarily of silt, sand, and gravel deposited by the river and periodically inundated during floods. They occupy valley bottoms but are dynamic features that are formed, eroded, and abandoned by rivers over time.</p>
				<p>Floodplains are an important part of the Puget Sound landscape, particularly in the lowlands along large rivers. They are used by people for cities, farms, and transportation. They provide habitats for fish and wildlife, which in turn play a role in meeting economic, cultural, and recreational needs. They store and route water through river corridors during floods, holding some of it to recharge groundwater sources. Protection and restoration of the services provided by floodplains is integral to the recovery of Puget Sound and the viability of its communities. </p>
				<p>Rivers and streams around Puget Sound respond to winter storms and melting snowpack by rising and flooding low-lying areas in the floodplain. By absorbing this overflow, floodplains provide functions and services like refuge, food, and fresh water for a variety of species, rich agricultural land, and level land that supports a variety of human uses. Unfortunately, floodplains have been degraded over time. Projects are underway to better manage floodplains, restore hydrologic connectivity and natural flows, reduce flood hazards, and improve habitat for salmon.</p>
				<p>For each of Puget Sound’s 17 major rivers, the extent of floodplains was estimated using two different approaches:</p>
				<p>1.	The Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) 500-year floodplain extent (where there is 0.2 percent chance of a flood hazard every year; FEMA 1996, 2015).</p>
				<p>2.	The U.S. Geological Survey’s floodplain assessment based on landform and water surface elevation (Konrad 2015).</p>
				
				<!--*********************************PURPLE HEADER*********************************-->
				<div class="purpBarHeader">What are the targets? </div>
				<h5>2020 target</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Restore, or have projects underway to restore, 15% of degraded Puget Sound floodplain area. </li>
				</ul>
				<h5>Interim targets</h5>
				<p>There currently are no interim targets for this Vital Sign (but there are interim targets for output targets).</p>

			<h3><a href="#!">Progress summary and data</a></h3>
			<div> 
				<!--*********************************PINK HEADER*********************************-->
				<div class="purpBarHeader"><strong>Is the indicator making progress toward the 2020 target? </strong></div>
				<p><span><img src="images/status_getting_better.png" width="120" height="123" alt=""/></span>Yes, this indicator has made gains relative to the baseline reference.</p>
				<p>A total of 39 projects were completed, amounting to 58 square kilometers, from Federal Fiscal Year 2011 to 2014.</p>
				<p>In recognition of past and ongoing efforts to improve the condition of floodplains, progress toward the 2020 target is categorized as getting better. However, in order to report against the 2020 target, more information is needed to define function and degradation of floodplains and to evaluate the impact of floodplain restoration projects.</p>
				<p>Using the regional land cover and change analysis available for 2011 from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric (NOAA) Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP), human development in the two floodplain extents described above ranges from 787 square kilometers (51 percent of the FEMA floodplain extent of 1,500 square kilometers) down to 535 square kilometers (54 percent of the USGS floodplain extent of 1,000 square kilometers). </p>
				<p>Land development in floodplains is a cause of degradation of floodplain function. However, floodplain function can be degraded by features other than land development (for instance, a levee disconnecting a portion of floodplain from the river’s main stem). Thus, areas degraded by development do not represent the full potential for habitat restoration.</p>
				
<div class="purpBarHeader">Latest Data</div>
				<img src="images/floodplains.png" width="800" height="699" alt=""/>
				<p>Because floodplains support a variety of functions and are impacted by human uses in different ways (e.g., disconnected from a river, converted to farms, pavement, and buildings) that affect functions, the floodplain recovery target does not translate simply into a single number for restoration. As a result, it may be necessary to consider targets for individual functions to recover the two key ecological attributes of floodplains: connectivity and condition. </p>
<p>The current status of floodplain condition and connectivity are currently being assessed as part of the “Floodplains by Design” project, a collaboration between the Puget Sound Partnership, the Department of Ecology and other agencies and organizations, to provide a basis for calculating the extent of action needed to achieve the floodplain recovery target.</p>
