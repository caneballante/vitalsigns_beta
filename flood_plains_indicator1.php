								<div class="purpBarHeader">What is the indicator? </div>
								<p>A working group comprised of floodplain experts is developing definitions and data for this target, which will be available in late 2014.</p>

<p>Floodplains are an important part of the Puget Sound landscape particularly in the lowlands along large rivers. They are used by people for cities, farms, and transportation. They provide habitats for fish and wildlife, which in turn play a role in meeting economic, cultural, and recreational needs. They store and route water through river corridors during floods, holding some of it to recharge groundwater sources. Protection and restoration of the services provided by floodplains is integral to the recovery of Puget Sound and the viability of its communities.
</p>

<p>Floodplains are areas adjacent to rivers that are formed primarily of silt, sand, and gravel deposited by the river and periodically inundated during floods. They occupy valley bottoms but are dynamic features that are formed, eroded, and abandoned by rivers over time.</p> 

<p>Floodplain functions and services have been significantly altered or lost through a combination of shoreline and river bank armoring; levees and flood regulation by dams; and residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural development. These activities disconnect floodplains from their rivers, eliminate channels and wetland areas that provided “off-channel” aquatic habitats, convert forests that would have naturally grown on floodplains to other types of land cover, and degrade the ability of floodplains to absorb water or provide a host of other ecological services that are important to communities.</p>

							
								<!--*********************************PURPLE HEADER*********************************-->
								<div class="purpBarHeader">What are the targets? </div>
								<h5>2020 target</h5>

								
								<ul><li>Restore, or have projects underway to restore, 15% of degraded Puget Sound floodplain area. </li>
<li>Have no net loss of floodplain function in any watershed.</li>
</ul>
	<h5>Interim targets</h5>
	<p>There currently are no interim targets for this Vital Sign (but there are interim targets for output targets).</p>
								
								<!--*********************************PURPLE HEADER*********************************-->
								<div class="purpBarHeader">Is there progress? </div>
								<p>The analysis of progress toward the 2020 target is pending until the characterization of floodplains and the definition of what "to restore" means are completed.</p>
                                <p>The Puget Sound Partnership Leadership Council established a target for recovery of the ecological connectivity and condition of 15 percent of the degraded floodplains in our region by 2020. Because floodplains support a variety of functions and are impacted by human uses in different ways (e.g., disconnected from a river, converted to farms, pavement, and buildings) that affect functions, the floodplain recovery target does not translate simply into a single number for restoration. As a result, it may be necessary to consider targets for individual functions to recover the two key ecological attributes of floodplains: connectivity and condition. The current status of floodplain condition and connectivity are currently being assessed as part of the “Floodplains by Design” project, a collaboration between the Puget Sound Partnership and other agencies and organizations, to provide a basis for calculating the extent of action needed to achieve the floodplain recovery target.</p>

						<h3><a href="#!">Latest data and maps</a></h3>
						<div> <div class="purpBarHeader">Data</div>
<p>There are about 2,500 sq km of valley bottom where floodplains could occur along the 17 major rivers in the Puget Sound basin. The widest valleys with the largest floodplains are in the eastern lowlands between Puget Sound and the Cascade Range where glaciers carved troughs that were subsequently filled with glacial and alluvial (river) sediments.</p>

<p>Not all of the valley bottom would have functioned as floodplains at any single point in time: based on topographic analyses there are about 1,500 sq km of valley bottom along the 17 major rivers that could be inundated periodically (about everydecade) and, thus, represent one measure of potential floodplain area. The remaining 1,000 sq km of valley bottom is either too high or otherwise isolated from smaller flood events.</p>

<p>Preliminary analysis is beginning to indicate the extent of degradation of floodplain connectivity and condition across Puget Sound. About 950 sq km of the potential floodplain area has no roads or levees separating it from a river. It is likely that much of the other 550 sq km floodplain area is “disconnected” meaning that floodwater is not able to flow freely into and out of these areas because of roads or levees.</p>

<p>Currently about 75 sq km of the potential floodplain area has medium to high levels of urban development, which makes recovery of many ecological functions costly and more challenging due to the extent of the disturbance. Medium and high development areas are based on NOAA CCAP data, which classified LandSat imagery from 2006. High development area contains littleor no vegetation. This subclass includes heavily built-up urban centers aswell as large constructed surfaces in suburban and rural areas.  Large buildings (such as multiple family housing, hangars, and large barns),interstate highways, and runways typically fall into this subclass. Mediumdevelopment area contains substantial amounts of constructed surface mixedwith substantial amounts of vegetated surface. Small buildings (such assingle family housing, farm outbuildings, and large sheds), typically fallinto this subclass.Impervious surfaces account for 50-79 percent of the total cover.</p>
