				<div class="aquaBarHeader">What is the indicator? </div>
				<h5>This indicator is the Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity.</h5>
<p>The Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity (B-IBI) describes the biological condition of stream sites and their surrounding habitat based on the diversity and relative abundance of the benthic (bottom dwelling) macroinvertebrates living there, such as mayfly larvae, stonefly larvae, caddisfly larvae, worms, beetles, snails, dragonfly larvae, and many others.</p>
<p>Ten measures of biological condition are scored and summarized as the B-IBI, which ranges from a score of 10, indicating a very poor stream condition, to 50, indicating excellent condition. A total of 398 streams were assessed for biological condition.</p>
<p>Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity data are routinely collected and reported by more than 20 local jurisdictions, tribes, and other state and federal organizations in Puget Sound for a variety of reasons. The Washington Department of Ecology samples 50 randomly selected stream and river sites every four years to get an unbiased estimate of regional conditions. Snohomish and King counties also randomly select stream sites to estimate regional condition using the B-IBI. </p>

				<h5>2020 target:</h5>
				<ol><li>Protect: 100 percent of Puget Sound lowland stream drainage areas ranked as excellent retain excellent scores for the Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity for biological condition</li>
<li>Restore: Improve and restore at least 30 streams ranked fair so their scores become good.</li></ol>

            <h5>Is the indicator making progress toward the 2020 target? </h5>
            <p><span><img src="images/status_mixed_results.png" width="118" height="121" alt=""/>The results for this indicator are mixed.  </span></p>
            <p>Progress toward these 2020 freshwater quality targets was mixed, at best. Overall, biological condition at some sites is declining, improving at others, and not changing at most. Because the B-IBI results indicate degradation in some streams ranked as excellent, but yet a net improvement in the biological condition of streams previously ranked fair by the B-IBI, there is mixed progress toward the 2020 target.</p>
<ul><li>Only 76 percent of streams previously ranked as excellent maintained their excellent ranking (Part 1 of the target).</li>
<li>The B-IBI results also indicate that more fair stream sites improved to good or excellent than declined to poor or very poor during 2011-2014 compared to 2006–2009 (Part 2 of the target).</li></ul>

<p>From 2007-2011, a total of 245 stream sites were sampled more than once. Of these, a total of 128 sites had initial B-IBI scores indicating “fair” condition (Figure 4 in Latest data and maps sections). The biological condition of most of these sites did not change. Consistent with the 2020 target, 11 of the 128 sites improved and changed categories to “good” or “excellent". However, 26 stream sites declined and changed status from “fair” to “poor” or “very poor”. The net difference in the change in status of 15 streams represents an overall decline (12 percent) in the biological condition of "fair" streams.</p>
<p>For the streams with “excellent” biological condition as rated by the B-IBI, some streams are already protected. A detailed analysis has not been done to identify which streams and watersheds should be protected for this target. The watersheds will likely be small, five to 20 square miles.</p>

Annual, 2007 – 2011 
</h5>

			  <p>B-IBI scores by category of biological condition for Puget Sound streams. Shown are the most recent data for each site. <br />
                <em>Source: Puget Sound Stream Benthos</em></p>
<p>Biological condition ranged from very poor to excellent for streams assessed between 2007 and 2011. The majority of streams (88 percent) rated very poor, poor or fair, while fewer than 12 percent of streams were rated as good or excellent (Figure 2).</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity (B-IBI) scores were lower in areas with greater urban development (Figure 4). The B-IBI is highly correlated with development and component metrics respond to specific aspects of disturbance. For example, long-lived species tend to decline as stream flows become higher in wet periods and lower in dry periods. Stoneflies also decline when natural vegetation near the stream is removed. Stream invertebrates are also sensitive to sediment, toxics, increased temperatures, and loss of habitat.</p>

<h5>FIGURE 3. NUMBER OF SMALL STREAMS WHOSE STATUS FOR BIOLOGICAL CONDITION CHANGED BETWEEN 2007 AND 2011, BASED ON B-IBI SCORES FOR 128 STREAMS IN PUGET SOUND
2007 – 2011 
</h5>
<p><img src="images/freshwater_chart4.png" /></p>
<p>From 2007 to 2011, B-IBI was measured more than once at 245 sites. Of these, 128 stream sites were raided as &ldquo;fair&rdquo; by B-IBI for the first visit. Of these, 11 improved in condition to &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;excellent: condition; 26 declined in condition to &ldquo;poor&rdquo; or &ldquo;very poor,&rdquo; and 91 were still rated as &ldquo;fair.&rdquo;<br />
<em>Source: Puget Sound Stream Benthos</em></p>
<p>For sites with repeat visits during the last five years, more sites have declined in biological condition from &ldquo;fair&rdquo; to &ldquo;poor&rdquo; or &ldquo;very poor&rdquo; (29 percent) than have improved to &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; condition (9 percent; Figure 3). These B-IBI scores were not derived from a random sample design and, therefore, do not necessarily represent the entire Puget Sound area.</p>
<p>For 84 sites with long-term data in King County, scores for 68 sites did not change (81 percent), 10 improved (12 percent), and six declined (7 percent).</p>
