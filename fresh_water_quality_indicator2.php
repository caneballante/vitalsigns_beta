				<p>The number of impaired waters .</p>
				<h4 class="aqua">Number of impaired waters</h4>
				<p>Impaired waters are segments of streams, rivers, or lakes that do not meet the State of Washington’s Water Quality Standards for bacteria, dissolved oxygen, temperature, toxics, or other pollutants. Cool, clean water is a key ingredient for a healthy Puget Sound. When lakes and streams have a reduced ability to support native species and human uses, then they are listed as Impaired.</p>
				<p>The Washington State Department of Ecology reviews data from a variety of sources every four years to identify impairments. The data used to list segments as impaired must meet rigorous data quality standards as outlined in Washington’s Water Quality Policy 1-11.</p>
				<p>Under the Federal Clean Water Act of 1972, waters are considered impaired when they fail to meet water quality standards or minimum requirements for certain uses. Every two years, states are required to prepare a list of water bodies that do not meet water quality standards. This list is called the 303(d) list, because the process is described in Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act. To achieve this goal, the State of Washington established water quality standards designed to protect and restore water quality for drinking, recreation, and habitat for fish and other aquatic life.</p>
				<p>More than one segment of a river can be listed as impaired, and a single segment can be listed for more than one pollutant. Once a segment is listed as impaired, a plan must be created and implemented to control pollution or improve water quality. The effects of these restoration programs can take many years to have a positive impact. </p>

				<h4 class="aqua">Number of impaired waters</h4>
				<p>Although the number of impairments for rivers and streams decreased by 77 segments in 2010 - a step in the right direction - it does not mean that these segments now meet water quality standards. Instead, the change in number of impairments was largely due to the number of segments receiving approval for their water quality improvement project plans or pollution control programs. </p>
				<p>Having a plan in place removes a segment from the impairment list, but does not necessarily mean that the area has been restored or that water quality standards are being met. For example, only four segments from the 2010 list were removed from the impaired list because they met water quality standards. </p>
				<p>New data for freshwater were not reviewed in 2010; the 2012 water quality assessment will use new data and be published sometime in 2013. The number of freshwater impairments is likely to rise significantly in 2012 due to an increase in data and the number of sites assessed. Comparing the number of impairments for 2008 to 2012 will be difficult because the method used to map and count segments will change. </p>

				<img src="images/freshwater_chart2.png" width="800" height="880" alt="Number of streams and river segments listed in each assessment category, 2008 and 2010" />
				<p>In the Puget Sound basin, the 2010 Water Quality Assessment showed a total of 6,957 segment and parameters combinations were assessed. A total of 1,496 river and stream segments, in 525 rivers and streams, did not meet Water Quality Standards and thus were listed as impaired.</p>
				<p>Impairments occurred in all 19 Water Resource Inventory Areas (WRIAs) in the Puget Sound basin (Figures 5 to 7). More than 60% of the total number of listings for Puget Sound rivers and streams were in five watersheds: Nooksack (296 listings), Kitsap (194), Cedar/Sammamish (181), Duwamish-Green (132), and Lower Skagit-Samish (109). For Puget Sound lakes, 52 were listed as impaired; 48% were listed for bacteria and total phosphorus, and approximately one-half were listed for toxic chemical contamination.</p>
				<p>The most frequently cited data for listing segments as impaired were bacteria (524 listings), dissolved oxygen (460), temperature (353), and pH (97). However, the largest number of segments (39%) could not be categorized because of insufficient data. Water Quality Standards include strict rules about the number of samples required to determine whether a segment is impaired or meeting standards.</p>
				<p>Segments listed as waters of concern have data that indicate a problem, but not enough data to make a determination of impairment.</p>
				<p>Sampling of streams, rivers, and lakes tends to focus in areas with known problems; therefore, not all segments have been assessed, and some impairments can be missed. Consequently, impairment data are not a complete reflection of the overall health of all streams, rivers, and lakes in Puget Sound watersheds.</p>
				<p>In addition, selection of monitoring sites is frequently constrained by funding. Monitoring efforts are split between monitoring established sites and looking for new problems. This limits the numbers of new waters that are addressed during a cycle.</p>
