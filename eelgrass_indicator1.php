<p>Eelgrass is an important submerged marine plant growing throughout Puget Sound. Changes in the
abundance or distribution of this resource reflect changes in environmental conditions.</p>

<p>Eelgrass and other seagrass species are used as indicators of ecosystem health throughout the world because they respond to many natural and human-caused environmental factors that affect water quality. These factors are also likely to affect many other species that depend on eelgrass habitat.</p>

<p>For example, excess nutrients, sewage, and algae can reduce water clarity, while storms, runoff, and dredging can stir up sediment, preventing light from penetrating the water and reaching the eelgrass. Boat wakes, propellers, and docks can also disturb eelgrass beds.</p>

<p>Since eelgrass is protected by many regulations, its condition reflects, in part, the success of management actions. The Washington State Department of Natural Resources assesses status and trends in eelgrass by evaluating eelgrass area and depth range at more than 100 sites throughout Puget Sound annually.
</p>
<p>Two measures are used to demonstrate eelgrass status and trends in Puget Sound:</p>
<ol>
<li> Soundwide native seagrass area: the total area of eelgrass and other native seagrass species in Puget Sound. </li><li>Number of increasing, decreasing, or stable eelgrass beds: count of eelgrass gains and losses on a per site basis.</li>
</ol>
							
								<!--*********************************PURPLE HEADER*********************************-->
								<div class="purpBarHeader">What are the targets?</div>
								<h5>2020 target</h5>
								<p>A 20% increase in the area of eelgrass in Puget Sound relative to the
2000-2008 baseline reference by the year 2020.</p>
									<h5>Interim targets</h5>

                                 <p>Soundwide eelgrass area has changed little since the monitoring program started. Between 2000 and 2008, total eelgrass area in Puget Sound was approximately 53,300 acres. Currently, the soundwide estimate of eelgrass cover hovers around 57,000 acres, based on the 2011 to 2013 average. Though the 2011-2013 acreage represents approximately a 7% increase relative to the 2000-2008 baseline, the increase is small and has a wide uncertainty range. There has been little progress towards the 2020 target of a 20% increase in soundwide area, but recent increases in eelgrass area at local scales provide reason for cautious optimism regarding future gains.</p>
							
										<p>Between 2000 and 2013, the Washington State Department of Natural Resources sampled eelgrass at
								347 sites across Puget Sound. The majority of these sites were stable: they showed no changes in eelgrass area since monitoring began (209 sites). Between 2003 and 2013, there were slightly more sites with decreasing trends (25) in eelgrass area than sites with increases in eelgrass area over time (17). In recent years there has been a shift in this pattern. From 2010 to 2013, several sites that were previously declining have stabilized or show a recent increase in eelgrass area. It is too early to tell if this trend will continue over the coming years, or if it is a temporary deviation from the long-term pattern.</p>


<p>Restoration actions may be leading to increases in eelgrass area at river deltas, an important habitat for salmon and many other organisms. At the Skokomish River in lower Hood Canal and the Nisqually River in southern Puget Sound, notable increases in eelgrass area were observed following removal of dikes and other restoration activities. Despite these efforts, it is difficult to predict whether the goal of 20% increase by 2020 will be met. The stresses on eelgrass in Puget Sound will likely need to be reduced to see soundwide gains in eelgrass area and health.</p>

								<img src="images/eelgrass_2015_chart1.png" width="550" height="586" alt="Acres of eelgrass in Puget Sound, in thousands, 2000-2008 baseline and 2009-2011 annual data" />
<p>Soundwide eelgrass area has not increased relative to the 2000-2008 baseline. There is no significant trend in eelgrass area between 2009 and 2013.</p>


<p>Puget Sound supports roughly 55,000 acres of eelgrass beds (long term average 2000-2013). Eelgrass distribution patterns vary across Puget Sound, with two main types of eelgrass beds: narrow fringing beds and broad beds on shallow flats. Approximately 25% of the total eelgrass area occurs in only two embayments: Padilla and Samish Bay.</p>


<p>The total amount of eelgrass in Puget Sound has been relatively stable from 2000 to 2013. When looking on a site by site basis, the situation is more dynamic. At the majority of the sampled sites, there was no change or trend in the size of eelgrass beds. Lower Hood Canal and southern Puget Sound have the greatest number of sites where the amount of eelgrass decreased, including several sites where eelgrass beds completely disappeared (see maps).
</p>
			

<h4 class="purp"><img src="images/eelgrass_2015_chart2.png" width="550" height="586" alt="Status of eelgrass sites in Puget Sound" /></h4>
<p>When comparing long-term (2003-2013) with recent (2010-2013) trends, there is a higher percentage of sites with gains in eelgrass area in the recent years (16% vs 5%).</p>

<p>Between 2003 and 2013, a total of 347 sites were classified for eelgrass trends over time.  Most of these sites were stable throughout the entire monitoring record. Twenty-five sites decreased in eelgrass area, 17 sites increased in eelgrass area, 209 sites experienced no detectable change, and 60 sites did not have seagrass beds present. Thirty-six sites had insufficient data for trend analysis (sampled only 1 year). In recent years, eelgrass conditions have improved. Out of the 156 sites sampled between 2010 and 2013, there were more sites with increasing (25) than decreasing (5) eelgrass area.  The recent increases in eelgrass area at these sites do not compensate for the local losses seen over the last decade, but nonetheless reflect a recent reversal in trend.</p>


<h4 class="purp">Hood Canal</h4>
<p> In many places throughout the world, eelgrass is threatened by excess nitrogen loading from human
sources. These extra nutrients contribute to the excessive growth of macroalgae in eelgrass beds, and promote the growth of plankton which reduces water clarity. This causes stress to eelgrass and contributes to its observed decline. Eelgrass in lower Hood Canal has been showing signs of long term decline, which may be related to nutrient stress. While the majority of nitrogen loading in this area is not from human sources, water quality in lower Hood Canal can be a concern because of stratification and long residence times.</p>



<p>Recently, eelgrass at some sites in Hood Canal has increased. Gains at the Skokomish River delta could be related to delta restoration activities. Increases at other sites could be related to natural conditions or to management actions.</p>
<h4 class="purp">Effects of delta restoration</h4>
<p>Along the Skokomish River delta, three sites have gained more than 200 acres of eelgrass. The eelgrass increases were first noted in 2010, following restoration work that was initiated in 2006 to remove dikes and restore tidal channels. Subsequent increases in eelgrass area were observed in 2013. At the Nisqually River delta, eelgrass area increased by at least 75 acres between 2006 and 2013. These increases followed the largest dike removal effort in the Pacific Northwest in 2009 (http://nisquallydeltarestoration.org).</p>
<h4 class="purp">The San Juan Islands</h4>
<p>Eelgrass can grow to more than 10 meters deep in the clear water surrounding the San Juan Islands. Despite the generally high water quality, some eelgrass beds in shallow embayments of the San Juan Islands show signs of decline.  While the causes of these declines are not yet known, researchers at Friday Harbor Laboratories have hypothesized that increased sediment sulfide concentrations impact the survival of young plants at these locations. Another potential cause is the occurrence of infections with Labyrinthula, a microorganism that causes eelgrass wasting disease.</p>
