			<h3><a href="#!">Importance to Puget Sound recovery</a></h3>
			<div>
				<p>Floodplains work like giant sponges. As rains increase with fall storms and snowpack melts in the mountains in spring and early summer, waters in the rivers around Puget Sound rise and flood low-lying land along the rivers and streams. In addition to absorbing this overflow, floodplains provide functions and services like refuge, food, and fresh water for a variety of species, good agricultural land through soil and habitat formation, and flat land that supports a variety of human uses.</p>
				<p>Unfortunately, the functions and services in large areas of floodplains in Puget Sound have been lost through a combination of shoreline armoring and levees, as well as residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural development. Improving riverside and floodplain habitat is a key part of virtually all recovery plans for endangered salmon. Restoration and better management of floodplains are essential for both recovering salmon and Puget Sound.</p>

			<h3><a href="#!">What you can do</a></h3>
			<div>
				<ol>
					<li>Keep people and property out of flood-prone areas.</li>
					<li>Protect floodplain areas that can still provide functions like flood storage and salmon habitat.</li>
					<li>Avoid building in a flood-prone area unless you plan to elevate and reinforce your home and its utilities (such as the furnace and electric panel).</li>
					<li>Find out how your insurance rates are affected by your risk of flood loss and how these rates can be reduced with good flood management planning.</li>
					<li>If you live in a floodplain area, learn about your local floodplain management plan and how to minimize your effect on the floodplain by visiting your city or county website.</li>
					<li>If you do not live in floodplain area, follow guidance on what you can do in your back yard by planting and maintaining native vegetation, and increasing water infiltration, in order to reduce water runoff. For more information on native plants, visit the <a href="http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/sea/pugetsound/species/native.html">Department of Ecology's website</a> or the <a href="http://www.wnps.org/index.html">Washington Native Plant Society</a>.</li>
					<li>If you have concerns about your property, consult the <a href="http://www.fema.gov/">Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)</a>, who can help fund qualified activities such as home elevations, relocations, and the acquisition and removal of structures in high-risk areas.</li>
