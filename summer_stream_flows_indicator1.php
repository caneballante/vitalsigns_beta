								<div class="blueBarHeader">What is the indicator? </div>
								<h4 class="blue">Summer low flows</h4>
						
										<p>Low flow occurs during summer months when there is less rain and warmer temperatures. Summer low flow is measured as the minimum 30-day average water flow at river and stream gaging stations maintained by the U.S. Geological Survey from July through October.</p>
										<p>The summer low flow indicator measures trends over a long time period. The indicator tracks how flow conditions are changing over the years, rather than comparing flow levels to a fixed value. The indicator is not sensitive to changes over a shorter time period, which makes it difficult to measure improving trends by 2020, even if significant flow restoration occurs. To measure a change, either large changes in flow must occur, such as a dam setting minimum downstream flows, or a very consistent change over a long period of time will be needed.</p>
										<p>The indicator tests whether the long-term trends of annual summer low flow levels are declining, increasing or stable (no trend). The trend test uses data collected since 1975, representing nearly 40 years of measurements. The advantage of a long-term data set is that the influence of climate changes associated with regional cooling and warming cycles (e.g., the phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation) are minimized over time.</p>
										<p>Specific targets were created for 12 rivers in the 2020 Action Agenda. The target language makes a distinction between regulated rivers (i.e. there is one or more dam on the river) and unregulated rivers. Rivers with large dams have highly managed flows and have specified minimum mitigation flows that can have a large influence on the trends in summer low flows. </p>

								<!--*********************************BLUE HEADER*********************************-->
								<div class="blueBarHeader">What are the targets? </div>
								<h5>2020 target</h5>
								<p>By 2020, meet the following river-specific targets:</p>
								<ul>
										<li>Maintain stable or increasing flows in highly regulated rivers: Nisqually, Cedar, Skokomish, Skagit, Green.</li>
										<li>Monitor low flow in the Elwha River after dam removal.</li>
										<li>Maintain stable flows in unregulated rivers that currently are stable: Puyallup, Dungeness, Nooksack.</li>
										<li>Restore low flows to bring the Snohomish River from a weakly decreasing trend to no trend.</li>
										<li>Restore low flows to bring the Deschutes River, North Fork Stillaguamish River, and Issaquah Creek from a strongly decreasing trend to a weakly decreasing trend.</li>
								</ul>
								<h5>Interim targets</h5>

								<!--*********************************BLUE HEADER*********************************-->
								<div class="blueBarHeader">Is there progress? </div>
								<p>The summer low flow indicator showed some progress relative to the baseline reference. During the period from 1975 to 2013, 83 percent of rivers met their target value for summer low flow trends (10 of 12 rivers). The baseline reference percentage, calculated for the period from 1975 to 2011, was 58 percent (seven of 12 rivers). The Nooksack, Deschutes and Snohomish joined the list of rivers who met their target value. Summer low flow in the Issaquah Creek, North Fork Stillaguamish, Snohomish River as well as Deschutes continue to be concerning, as they have persistently been decreasing since 1975.</p>

										<p>The 2020 target is limited to 12 rivers. To provide a more complete regional picture, 17 additional gages were also evaluated for the period 1975-2014. Of the 29 gages used to measure summer low flow (shown in figure above):</p>
										<ul>
												<li>Sixteen gages are located near the mouth of major rivers or small streams that drain directly to Puget Sound. </li>
												<li>Four gages are from upstream sites on the mainstem of major rivers.</li>
												<li>Nine gages are from tributaries to major rivers.										</li>
										</ul>
										<p>Of the stations assessed, 66% had stable or increasing summer low flows (19 out of 29). The remaining 10 rivers have either weakly or strongly decreasing flows. Given the importance of adequate water supply for salmon, other wildlife and humans, some areas in Puget Sound may be cause for concern.</p>
										<p>Rivers regulated by dams with mandatory minimum downstream flows generally were stable or showed increasing trends (Skagit, Cedar, Green, Puyallup, Nisqually, and Skokomish rivers). Some of the glacier-fed upper tributaries had increasing trends (North Fork Nooksack River, Puyallup River at Orting, Nisqually River near National). This could be the result of climatic warming trends and glacial recession.</p>
										<p>The Cedar River is another regulated river. The gaging station near Landsburg, located immediately below the reservoir but above the City of Seattle water diversion, had a weak decreasing trend, while the Cedar River at Renton (near the mouth of the river) showed a strong increasing trend. Summer low flows upstream were almost twice the low flows downstream. The Cedar River is considered important habitat for salmon and suggests that the implementation of the City of Seattle Habitat Conservation Plan is improving summer low flows</p>
										<p>The seven rivers with either strongly or weakly decreasing flows are cause for concern. Some of these water bodies, like Issaquah and Mercer creeks are in urban areas. Others, namely the North Fork Stillaguamish, South Fork Snoqualmie, and Raging rivers, are in areas experiencing population growth. The effect of increased impervious surfaces and ground and surface water withdrawals could be affecting those summer low flow levels. The Deschutes River gaging station is mostly forested land. However, decreasing summer low flows there may be due to forest practices or climate change. </p>
								<p>The Dungeness River showed a weak increasing trend for the upper watershed. Current work to restore flows in the developed areas of the lower watershed is occurring downstream of this gage.</p>
								<p>In general, flows were higher than normal in most Puget Sound rivers and creeks in 2014. Exceptions were the Raging River and Cedar River which had below-average summer low flows.

								<!--*********************************BLUE HEADER*********************************-->
								<h4 class="blue">Why is this happening?			</h4>
								<p>A variety of factors are potential drivers for summer low flow trends. A more detailed analysis is needed to better understand these drivers. However, some observations are possible.</p>
								<p>The principal driver for summer low flows is weather conditions during the previous year. Puget Sound rivers and streams fall into three general categories:</p>
								<ul>
										<li><strong>Rain-dominated</strong>: these basins are at a low elevation where most precipitation is in the form of rain and any snow melts quickly. Summer flows are ground-water dominated.</li>
										<li><strong>Transition, or mixed rain-snow</strong>: these are mid-elevation basins that may have winter snowpack but are also susceptible to rain-on-snow events or lack of snowpack in mild winters. Summer flows come from groundwater, but percolation of snowmelt can have a large effect.</li>
										<li><strong>Snow-dominated</strong>: these basins have significant high elevation areas with deep winter snowpack. Summer flows may be affected by late snowmelt or glacier melt. </li>
								</ul>
								<p>Summer low flows in streams are expected to track the weather conditions across the basin. Therefore, when a basin deviates from the regional tendency for the year, it suggests other drivers are in play. </p>
								<p>Long-term trends in climate change may already be affecting flows in some systems. Glaciers are receding, and the increasing flows in rivers with large glaciers in the headwaters could reflect the rapid loss of glacial mass in the summer. Transition basins are expected to be the most sensitive to changes in snow pack. However, decreased percolation and higher summer temperatures could affect summer flows in rain-dominated basins, too. The specific effect of climate change on Puget Sound rivers and streams needs further analysis.</p>
								<p>Large dams provide the greatest impact on summer low flows. Prior to relicensing of the dams, summer low flows could be greatly reduced from natural conditions due to the operation of the dam to provide hydropower. However, over the last several decades dams have had minimum summer flows set in their licenses. As a result, flows below licensed dams are either stable or increasing, depending on how long the mitigation flows have been in effect.</p>
								<p>Direct diversion of flow from rivers in the summer can be a major driver of low flows. However, for most of the Puget Sound indicator gages there is relatively little agricultural flow diversion. Municipal diversions can have a large effect, but most of these now are subject to licensing requirements or salmon recovery plans. The Cedar River is a good example of this, demonstrated by its strongly increasing flows at the mouth.</p>
								<p>The last major driver is changes in watershed hydrology. Wells can reduce ground water flow that feeds summer low flow, and impervious surfaces can reduce percolation that feeds ground water. Changes in hydrology caused by human activities are more likely to have an impact in urban and rapidly growing residential areas. The fact that many of the rivers and creeks with declining trends are in these areas suggests that this driver may be significant in some areas.</p>
								<p>More detailed analysis is necessary to understand how these many drivers interact in a given basin. A better understanding of the drivers that can respond to changes in watershed and water management could help prioritize basins with declining summer flow trends and direct resources to where they could have the most benefit. Additional resources would need to be identified to do this analysis.</p>
