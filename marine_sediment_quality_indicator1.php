				<!--*********************************AQUA HEADER*********************************-->
				<div class="aquaBarHeader">What is the indicator? </div>
				<h4 class="aqua">This indicator is the Sediment Chemistry Index.</h4>
				<p>The Sediment Chemistry Index (SCI) is one component of the Sediment Quality Triad Index (SQTI), one of the other indicators for this Vital Sign. It combines data on the concentrations of a variety of chemicals for which state Sediment Quality Standards Chemical Criteria have been set into an overall index of chemical exposure (Table 1). Contaminants measured as part of the SCI include metals, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs – flame retardants), chlorinated pesticides, phthalates, some solvents, and various other pollutants. Higher index values indicate less exposure to chemicals and thus healthier sediments (Table 1).</p>
<p>Analyses for newer chemicals of concern, such as dioxins, furans, endocrine disrupting chemicals, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and perfluorinated chemicals, are not conducted as part of the Puget Sound Ecosystem Monitoring Program sediment component, and therefore not included in these Sediment Quality Dashboard Indicators.</p>
<p>Tracking the SCI gives an indication of how concentrations of those chemicals in marine sediments change over time, primarily in response to anthropogenic input, such as stormwater runoff and direct discharge, as well as cleanup activities and passive burial as cleaner sediments settle over older, and sometimes more contaminated, sediments.</p>

				<div class="aquaBarHeader">What are the targets? </div>
				<h5>2020 target</h5>
				<h4 class="aqua">Sediment Chemistry Index</h4>
				<p>By 2020, all Puget Sound regions and bays achieve chemistry measures reflecting “minimum exposure” with Sediment Chemistry Index (SCI) scores >93.3.</p>
				<h5><a href="http://www.psp.wa.gov/downloads/interimtargets/Marine Sediment Quality Interim Targets -FINAL.pdf">Interim targets (PDF)</a></h5>
                <h5>Interim Targets:</h5>
                <p>2014 Interim target:</p>
<ol><li>All regions meet marine sediment targets for SCI.</li>
<li>SCI conditions in Elliott Bay improved relative to 2007.</li>
<li>Target conditions in Commencement Bay met in 2014.</li></ol>

				<h5>Is the indicator making progress toward the 2020 target? </h5>
                <p> <span><img src="images/status_not_changing.png" width="118" height="121" alt=""/>There was no significant trend for this indicator.</p>
                <p>Overall, sediments in Puget Sound have been and continue to be in generally good condition with regard to the measured set of chemicals, except in Elliott Bay near Seattle. </p>

<h5>Did the indicator meet its 2014 interim target?</h5>
<p>Because all the regions and Commencement Bay met their target values, except for Elliott Bay, which did not improve enough, the interim targets are only partly met.</p>
<ol><li>Sediment Chemistry Index scores for all regions, and most bays either meet or exceed the target value.</li>
<li>Since 1997, all of the eight sampled regions and five of six urban bays met the Sediment Chemistry Index (SCI) target value, and index values in most areas changed little since the late 1990s.</li>
<li>Conditions have improved significantly in Elliott Bay since 1998, but not enough to reach the target value. Although the index value is slightly higher in 2013 than in 2007 in Elliott Bay, the difference is not statistically significant.</li>
<li>The value measured for Admiralty Inlet dropped significantly when resampled in 2014, but still remained above the target value.</li>
<li>The values for Commencement Bay increased slightly between 2008 and 2014, and the target value is not met.</li></ol>
<p>Given that sediment contamination generally changes very slowly, we expect most areas currently meeting the target to continue to do so through 2020 unless contaminant inputs to the areas increase. It is possible that the target may eventually be reached in Elliott Bay if conditions there continue to improve.</p>
